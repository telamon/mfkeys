mfkeys is tool to extract keys from Mifare classic cards

It will try to recover the keys from faults in the authentication protocol 
in case not all keys can be found from default manifacture keys.

It uses two methods to recover keys:
* Darkside attack using parity bits leakage
* Nested Authentication using encrypted nonce leakage

The tool is intented as an alternative frontend to Mifare classic key recovery,
providing an automated solution with minimal user interaction.

a) If a keyfile is provided, mfkeys will check the keys and if valid, add them 
to the list of known keys.

b) If a single key is provided, each sector will be checked for this key and if 
valid, add it to the list of known keys for that particular sector.

c) If not skipped, mfkeys will also try a number of different vendor keys, 
default to the card when produced at the factory. Many cards are still in the 
wild with these.

d) If no keys has been found so far, mfkeys will try to recover the A-key for
the first sector using the Darkside attack.

e) The remaining unknown keys will be recovered using Nested Authentication.
